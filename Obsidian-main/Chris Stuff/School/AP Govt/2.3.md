Main:

-   The Virginia Plan – Proposed by Edmund Randolph from Virginia, this proposal suggested that representation for each state be based on its population.
-   The New Jersey Plan – A representative from New Jersey, William Patterson, proposed that each state ought to be represented equally in the new Congress.

-   The Connecticut Compromise struck a balance these two proposals and created a bicameral legislature, in which two houses of Congress would be created: one with the number of representatives proportional to the state’s population (the House of Representatives) and the other with equal representation for all the states (the Senate).

Questions:

In other words, how much power should each state have in the Congress?

Proportional representation meant that states should have power equal in weight to their populations.

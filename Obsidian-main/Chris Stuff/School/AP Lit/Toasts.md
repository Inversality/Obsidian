Dover Beach  
 

(Title) Dover beach is about a person either reflecting or sharing their experience at dover beach. Likely with nostalgia, sensory or emotional details the narrator will reveal his experience on why he would go back, or what makes this place so interesting for him or potentially promotion of it to others.

(Paraphrase)

The first stanza of "Dover Beach" uses emotional details to an inanimate entities such as the sea is calm, the sea brings sadness in etc this is helpful to help the reader step into the narrators shoes: by giving these inanimate objects sentient qualities it provides emotional context and creates a slur of emotions for the audience. The second opening of "Dover Beach" brings an abstract reality to Aegeans situation, and provides insight into how his mind operates when facing the reality of humanities dismay. How humanity is inter-connected is what I most receive from this specific part of the poem. (Paraphrased section) Sopholes in the past Heard from the Aegean, and received distress of humanity. Heard from the distant north waters, a thought of sound was found.

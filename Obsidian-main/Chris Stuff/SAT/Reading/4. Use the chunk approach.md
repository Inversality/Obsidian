-   You should solve this problem by conserving time and assuring comprehension on the SAT reading section.

-The chunk approach allows students to work through a passage in discrete "chunks".

The main idea behind "the chunk approach" is to read the first paragraph and develop a pkp. Then read the cited lines to answer the questions

The line-cited questions may not be so perfectly separated so you just have to read a larger chunk of information.

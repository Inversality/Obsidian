Modifiers are phrases that describe nouns

-   Typically they are seperated from the sentence by using one or more commas
-   For students who never studied for the SAT, these errors are often difficult to spot in everyday language we are accustomed to incorrect modifiers so errors will never "sound correct"
-   These modifiers are separated from the sentence using two commas. However, most modifiers have only one comma and often or end sentences.

-   You do not want to take notes during the sat because you simply don't have enough time to, but you do want to annotate paragraphs
-   It's not nescessary to annotate every paragraph but important ideas and large paragraphs or chunks of a paragraph
-   I annotate sparingly in order to conserve time

Nostalgia is great for writing because it touches the readers hearts. This feeling comes closest to writers which is why they express it as much as possible. Two stories "To His Coy Mistress" by Andrew Marvell and "Dover Beach" by Matthew Arnold express nostalgia: this is done by using particular shifts and figurative language which empowers the relative poems. "Dover beach" and "To his coy mistress," uses nostalgia to reflect on what is missing from their life and what they appreciated about their life. These poems also used personification to objectify the past. Finally these authors used shifts to express changes from stanza to stanza.
